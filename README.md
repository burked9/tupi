# tupi
This is from the git repository burked9/tupi and corresponds to the folder PATH\docs_djangoproject_tut01.
It is the django tutorial which is modified to contain some persons, import export, and then linked to an existing DB with models extracted from that.

All of them need work on the admin.py side, to update import and export, which may be the key to inventory updates.

There is work to be done on the index, the templates, and try to get multiple apps and models all working together.
